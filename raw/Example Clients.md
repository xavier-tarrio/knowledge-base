`mcpc` is a universal command-line client for MCP. It maps MCP operations to intuitive CLI commands, giving AI coding agents full protocol access through a single `Bash()` tool call. It works with any MCP server over Streamable HTTP or stdio, with or without a config file. Agents discover commands through `--help` without needing external skills, while MCP handles remote concerns like server discovery, authentication, payments, and access control.

**Key features:**

- **Code mode in the shell:** `--json` output composes with `jq`, `xargs`, and shell pipelines for writing MCP workflows as shell scripts, which can be more accurate and token-efficient than tool calling. `--schema` validates tool schemas against snapshots to detect breaking changes.
- **Progressive tool discovery:** `grep` searches tools, resources, and prompts across all active sessions with regex, so agents load only relevant tools into context.
- **Full MCP coverage:** tools, resources (including subscriptions and templates), prompts, instructions, async tasks with progress tracking and cancellation, list-change notifications, pagination, and logging control.
- **Persistent sessions:** maintain multiple simultaneous server connections via named `@sessions`, with automatic reconnection and health monitoring.
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.1 with PKCE and dynamic client registration, bearer tokens, multiple named profiles per server, and secure credential storage in the OS keychain.
- **AI sandboxing:** built-in MCP proxy server (`--proxy`) exposes authenticated sessions to AI-generated code without leaking credentials.
- **Interactive shell:** `shell` command provides a REPL with command history, arrow-key navigation, and in-session help for exploratory server testing.
- **x402 payments (experimental):** autonomous USDC payments on Base blockchain, letting AI agents pay for tool calls via the HTTP 402 protocol.
- **Lightweight and cross-platform:** no LLM required, minimal dependencies, production-ready. Runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Install via `npm install -g @apify/mcpc`.
