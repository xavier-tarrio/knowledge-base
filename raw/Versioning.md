The Model Context Protocol uses string-based version identifiers following the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, to indicate the last date backwards incompatible changes were made.

The protocol version will *not* be incremented when the protocol is updated, as long as the changes maintain backwards compatibility. This allows for incremental improvements while preserving interoperability.

## Revisions

Revisions may be marked as:

- **Draft**: in-progress specifications, not yet ready for consumption.
- **Current**: the current protocol version, which is ready for use and may continue to receive backwards compatible changes.
- **Final**: past, complete specifications that will not be changed.

The **current** protocol version is [**2025-11-25**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25).

## Negotiation

Version negotiation happens during [initialization](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest/basic/lifecycle#initialization). Clients and servers **MAY** support multiple protocol versions simultaneously, but they **MUST** agree on a single version to use for the session.

The protocol provides appropriate error handling if version negotiation fails, allowing clients to gracefully terminate connections when they cannot find a version compatible with the server.
